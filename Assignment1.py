# 1. Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple
# of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed in a
# comma-separated sequence on a single line.

# In[5]:


for i in range(2000,3201):
    if i%7 == 0 and i%5!=0:
        print(i,end=',')


# 2. Write a Python program to accept the user's first and last name and then getting them printed in
# the the reverse order with a space between first name and last name.

# In[6]:


fname = input("Input your First Name : ")
lname = input("Input your Last Name : ")
print (lname + " " + fname)


# 3. Write a Python program to find the volume of a sphere with diameter 12 cm.
# Formula: V=4/3 * Ï€ * r

# In[10]:


pi = 3.1415926535897931
r= 12
V= 4/3*pi* r**3
print('The volume of the sphere is: ',V)


# 4. Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and
# generate a list.

# In[18]:


values = input("Please provide sequence of comma-separated numbers ")
l = values.split(",")
print(l)
